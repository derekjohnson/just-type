# Just type

Like pretty much everyone else who's doing something similar I was inspired by https://coderwall.com/p/lhsrcq

Everything typed is put into localStorage and appcache is used to make it available offline.

Webfonts used are free from Font Squirrel http://www.fontsquirrel.com/

If you want a really good typing experience consider purchasing IA Writer http://www.iawriter.com/

## TODO

* Get the localStorage working in IE8
* Add buttons to change font-size
